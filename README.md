qvb

Implementation of lossy image/video compression using vector 
quantization (or block quantization)algorithm I wrote back in 2003-2004.

I became interested in the subject while implementing playback
of RoQ video format in qfusion.

Along with compression utility comes viewer of compressed .qvb
files which requires SDL to compile and run.

Beware, as the source code contains no comments!
